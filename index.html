                Hello!  Greeting from Waco, Tx - where I currently call home.  
        Originally from Ruston, LA and a Louisiana Tech Alumnus (Go Dawgs!!), 
        I have lived in 5 different cities across the US plus numerous other 
        countries for short stints.  To say I enjoy traveling would be a massive 
        understatement.  I love experiencing different cultures and even just the 
        process and logistics of travel.  Thatâ€™s probably weird, I know, but alas I 
        do love it.  There are definitely many more places yet to visit and/or live!
        <br>
        <br>
        A few years ago with several years of working for the VA as an Engineer/Project 
        Manager under my belt, I set out to change the world.  Long story short, 
        I have made my way to Waco where I am pursuing a career shift with coding/web 
        development - something I have been thinking about for what seems like a very 
        long time.  Fueled by coffee and CrossFit, I am excited to see what this journey 
        holds next!

<!--
    Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)

     * eg. On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. 
     On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and 
     right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device 
     versus your computer to see this in action!

   * Responsive images

   **BONUS**
   Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns 
   on your portfolio site _(Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)_

3. Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

4. Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.
